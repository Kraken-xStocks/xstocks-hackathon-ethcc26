## What is the xStocks Hackathon: Market Open?

The xStocks Hackathon: Market Open is an invite-only, in-person Hacker House taking place from **March 31st to April 2nd, 2026** in Cannes, France — within walking distance of the EthCC conference. It is a combination of a hackathon, workshops, and mentorship sessions, with a **$75,000 USD prize pool** up for grabs.

Hosted by **Kraken** in partnership with **xStocks**, this is an opportunity to build the next generation of onchain financial products using the xStocks tokenized equities framework.

### EthCC Conference

The EthCC conference runs concurrently in Cannes during the same period. Attendees of the hackathon are encouraged to also explore the broader EthCC schedule.

### Hackathon Venue

The hackathon takes place at a dedicated Hacker House in Cannes, France. Address will be shared with accepted applicants closer to the date.

## Hack Raison D'Être

1.  Competing for prizes by building meaningful projects using the xStocks tokenized equities framework.
2.  Contributing to the broader DeFi ecosystem by pushing the frontier of onchain structured products, lending, and automated investment strategies.

## The Build Tracks

Projects must meaningfully integrate the xStocks framework and fall into one of three tracks:

### Borrow / Lend
Build the next generation of onchain structured products and leveraged exposure. Focus on capital efficiency and composability using tokenized equities as collateral or yield-bearing assets.

### Frontend
Create user-friendly DeFi interfaces designed for everyday users. Think about how to make tokenized equities accessible, intuitive, and beautiful.

### Strategy
Build automated investing tools using Ethereum Smart Accounts for programmable investment strategies powered by xStocks assets.
